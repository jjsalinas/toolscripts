# toolscripts
Some scripts I use for various tasks related with folders duplicties, check subfolders for certain extension files, etc.

##### remove_duplicated_subfolders.ps1
PowerShell script to check and remove folders redundancy for two dirs  parent/folders and parent/subfolder/folders. 
Keeping only the duplicated folders only in parent/folders.

##### check_folders_for_subtitles.py
python script to check and print subfolders in a path which do not contain a .srt subtitle file. 
It is easy to modify to check for any other extension or substring in the filenames.
